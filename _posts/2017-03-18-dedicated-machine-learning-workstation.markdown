title: dedicated machine learning workstation
layout: post
---

after my old *5-node-raspy-2-distributed-computing-training cluster* 
found it's end in 2 other projects, 
i'm ready for a new project and repurpose my old workstation **AMD Phenom x6 1090T, SSD, Radeon HD6850**
as a server for playing with __Keras__ bundled with __Theano__ & __Tensorflow__
as well as __Caffe__ and the usual machine-learning-supects.

My goal is to use the server as a dedicated testing environment since i run
out of my AWS-student credit and hopefully get the hackish OpenCL versions/forks of the frameworks up and running.

For the base system i choose Xubuntu since i don't need the great amazon shopping lens and it's a more less hassle free experience for a headless server.

The software configuration is pretty straight forward, i need

- dtrx
- Anaconda 3
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- scikit-learn, scikit-image
- pillow
- pandas
- OpenCV

change my ssh-server-config to public-key authentication and im ready to go.

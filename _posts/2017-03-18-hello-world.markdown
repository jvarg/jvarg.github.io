Hello, 

i'm a twentysomething years old master student in computer science from germany
i'm starting a blog about programming i guess...
mostly in C++, python and golang.
Since i have to do it quite frequent you'll read about LaTex and creating nice plots i'll also write about image processing and biometrics
as well as other tech related topics which come to mind.

to close this post with some wise words:

Lorem ipsum dolor!
--julius caesar
